## JavaScript Calculator

This project was built for the Front End Libraries Specialization Pathway on [freeCodeCamp] and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

**Please note that this app functions with immediate execution logic**. 

For example: ```3 + 5 x 6 - 2 / 4 = 11.5 ```



Visit a live demo of the app [here](https://jsfcccalculator.netlify.app/)
